Our work focuses on developing a tool to help evaluate high-throughput phenotype candidates using PubMed, an online repository of medical literature. We use co-occurrence analysis to build sets of evidence for user-supplied candidate phenotypes.

This project is an ongoing collaboration between [Joydeep Ghosh](https://www.ideal.ece.utexas.edu/~ghosh/) and [Byron Wallace](http://www.byronwallace.com/).
