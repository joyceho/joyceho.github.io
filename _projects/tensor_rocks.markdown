Our research addresses the problem of transforming raw electronic health record (EHR) data to medical concepts with minimal human intervention. We posit the use of multi-relational tensor factorization approaches to generate concise and clinically relevant phenotypes. The tensor framework provides powerful, data-driven, and interpretable approaches for transforming high-dimensional EHR data into medical concepts.

This is a collaboration with UT-Austin, Georgia Tech, Vanderbilt, and Northwestern.
