Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) is a complex and devastating illness of unknown cause and origin. Patients are often on multiple medications to manage the symptoms. We use tensor factorization to improve our understanding of CFS as they provide a natural framework for flexible representation and analysis of multi-aspect data.

This is a collaboration with CDC.
