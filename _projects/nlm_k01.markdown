Diabetic patients are risk of developing diabetic heart disease which can lead to high healthcare expenditure, high resource utilization, and poor patient outcomes. Existing diabetic risk prediction models can suffer from poor calibration and predictive accuracy. This project develops a novel and practical analytic tool to identify patients at high-risk of developing diabetic heart disease.

The project is supported by the National Institute of Health (NIH) under award number 1K01LM012924.
